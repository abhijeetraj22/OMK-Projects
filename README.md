This code compares two Excel sheets by looking at three key pieces of information for each student: Name, Father's Name, and Mother's Name. If all three match in both sheets, it's considered a successful match.

From the first sheet, it pulls the SID (Student ID) and, if available, the Student PEN, and inserts these values into the second sheet where a match is found.

If no match is found, it labels that row as unmatched and leaves the SID and PEN columns empty or marked as "Not Found."

Finally, it saves two separate lists—matched records and unmatched records—in a new Excel file with two different sheets: one for matched students and one for unmatched ones.

This makes it easy to review which students were successfully matched and which were not.
